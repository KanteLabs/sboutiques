  "description": "Streetwear Boutiques was founded and created by, me Amidou Kante, in 2017 to bridge the gap between new clothing brands, and fashion lovers alike. I have always been interested in fashion, streetwear, and supporting smaller brands. However, there isn't a convenient way to explore all those brands, so I've decided to build a place where that is possible. I was inspired by various fashion communities and I'm on a mission to create a place for different labels to grow and flourish.",
